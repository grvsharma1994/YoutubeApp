Project: make a clone of https://www.youtube.com/ site

*Youtube is online platform that allows customer to watch videos online..  *

## Technology Stack Used

For storing user data we also used LocalStorage.

## Libraries Used ðŸŒŸ
All the image and icon links have been taken from the main website (  https://www.youtube.com/ )

### End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project I was tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of javascript & css. This entire journey of has given us experiences and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence.

### Limitations:
All pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
